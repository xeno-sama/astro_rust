This project contains two astronomical processors.

1: Simplified. The theory and formulas were taken from the website http://stjarnhimlen.se .

2: Accurate. The source code is taken in the C programming language from the cosinekitty/astronomy repository.

Both astro processors have been rewritten in the Dart and RUST languages.
